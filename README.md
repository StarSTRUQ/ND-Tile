# ND-Tile

Tile a scalar field in an N-dimensional independent variable space
using N-dimensional planar fitting, observing constraints on the
quality of the planar fits.

## Usage

To import Tiling, just add the ND-Tile directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

## Dependencies

* Python 3

* numpy

* scipy

## TODO

* Allow Python 2

* Add examples

* Add unit testing

* Domain slicing should plot all possible 2-D slices by default.

* Convert domain slicing code into an object to make it easier to pass
  arguments around that are general to the program.
